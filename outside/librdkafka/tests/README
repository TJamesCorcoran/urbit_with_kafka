Automated regression tests for librdkafka
=========================================

A local configuration file needs to be created to specify the broker address,
and possibly other rdkafka configuration properties:

    cp test.conf.example test.conf
    $EDITOR test.conf


To run tests:

    make


To run specific test(s):

    TESTS=0004-conf.test make



All tests in the 0000-0999 series are run automatically with 'make'.

Tests 1000-1999 are subject to specific non-standard setups or broker
configuration, these tests are run with "TESTS=1xxx-yyyyy.test make".
See comments in the test's source file for specific requirements.


The run-test.sh script can be modified to run tests in one or more of
the following modes:
 * bare  (default)
 * valgrind
 * helgrind
